# Blog post

This project uses the data published by the U.S. Federal Election in the 2015-2016 election cycle. The aim is to explore the expenditures and committee contributions for Democrats and Republicans in the presidential election.

Part 1 of the analysis looks into the total receipts for Democratic vs. Republican candidates in the presidential election and the correlation with total votes. Total receipts are the money the candidates had that they could spend (and didnâ€™t necessarily spend it all).
For our analysis, we got the total receipts and total votes, and our initial hypothesis was that perhaps there was some correlation between the amount of money they had to spend and the amount of votes they got, as they could put that money towards campaigning and other purposes. However, this was not the case, and there seemed to be no correlation between the two, even when removing outliers from the graph to see if a correlation exists for candidates with a lesser amount of total receipts. Furthermore, there seemed to be no correlation between those two variables and whether the candidate was a Democrat or Republican.

Part 2 of the analysis looks into the transactions made by the committees for candidates running in the presidential election in Pennsylvania. The two candidates running here in 2016 were Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump - the latter winning in the state. 
For our analysis, we get the total transaction amount for each category of transaction type for each candidate. Our initial hypothesis was that we would find some positive correlation with the amount of transactions in favor of the election result. However, we found that the highest transaction was made for Donald Trump's campaign opposing his candidacy (24A).
Independent expenditure advocating the candidacy (24E) was almost similar for both candidates. Clinton's campaign had significantly more expenditure for communication (24F) than that of Trump's. However, the amount of money spent against Trump's candidacy exceeds that of Clinton by a huge difference. Nevertheless, despite these factors, Trump had a successful race in Pennsylvania. The bar chart effectively helps us to visualize this insight.
