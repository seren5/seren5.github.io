This data aims to increase transparency and help prospective students and families compare colleges based on their goals and requirements. The College Scorecard was produced by the U.S. Department of Education taking data from the federal reporting from institutions, data on federal financial aid, and tax information. These were taken directly or derived from the data reported to the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS).\nFrom the dataset, we investigated our question using the data of 50 colleges in Massachusetts with the largest undergraduate student population. Delving deeper, we explored the governance structure and retention rates. Firstly, we grouped our selection of colleges based on the cities these are located in and then visualized the distribution of the type of governance structures – whether the colleges are Public, Private Non-profit, or Private For-profit. Then, we examined the correlation between retention rates and the undergraduate population based on the type of institution to help us draw conclusions from the data.\nThe first plot explores the governance structure of the largest 50 colleges in different cities of Massachusetts. The largest 50 schools are grouped with the cities these are located in and the length of the bars indicates the number of Public, Private Non-Profit, and Private For-Profit universities in each of those cities. Notably, there are no Private For-profit college in our selection, hence the bar chart omits the category. The plot concludes Boston has the highest number of big schools, followed by Worcester, Springfield, and Cambridge. The colors of the bars indicate that overall the number of public schools is higher than the number of private colleges in our selection of the largest MA colleges.\nThe second plot explores the correlation between the undergraduate population and the retention rate. For public colleges, we can see an inconclusive positive correlation between a larger undergraduate population and a higher retention rate as the points are scattered, showing that larger public universities are likely to have a higher retention rate. However, the points for private nonprofit colleges are in a larger cluster, signifying that there isn’t a direct and obvious correlation between undergraduate student body size and retention rate.\nAssumptions and commitments that informed this data set include assuming that the colleges participate in Title IV programs (or meet similar criteria to participating institutions), and that these colleges report wholly correct data to the IPEDS. However, a lot of the data is missing as colleges did not report some data to the IPEDS. The educational institutions and organizations collecting the data have had a say regarding this dataset, and it is hard to find reliable data if the institutions don’t report their information. The benefits and harms of this dataset may be (shouldn’t be, but) that institutions can pick and choose the data they present, so that either data is missing, or it is positively skewed towards certain institutions when it’s beneficial."

    "text": "Blog post\nThis project uses the data published by the U.S. Federal Election in the 2015-2016 election cycle. The aim is to explore the expenditures and committee contributions for Democrats and Republicans in the presidential election.\nPart 1 of the analysis looks into the total receipts for Democratic vs. Republican candidates in the presidential election and the correlation with total votes. Total receipts are the money the candidates had that they could spend (and didn’t necessarily spend it all). For our analysis, we got the total receipts and total votes, and our initial hypothesis was that perhaps there was some correlation between the amount of money they had to spend and the amount of votes they got, as they could put that money towards campaigning and other purposes. However, this was not the case, and there seemed to be no correlation between the two, even when removing outliers from the graph to see if a correlation exists for candidates with a lesser amount of total receipts. Furthermore, there seemed to be no correlation between those two variables and whether the candidate was a Democrat or Republican.\nPart 2 of the analysis looks into the transactions made by the committees for candidates running in the presidential election in Pennsylvania. The two candidates running here in 2016 were Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump - the latter winning in the state. For our analysis, we get the total transaction amount for each category of transaction type for each candidate. Our initial hypothesis was that we would find some positive correlation with the amount of transactions in favor of the election result. However, we found that the highest transaction was made for Donald Trump’s campaign opposing his candidacy (24A). Independent expenditure advocating the candidacy (24E) was almost similar for both candidates. Clinton’s campaign had significantly more expenditure for communication (24F) than that of Trump’s. However, the amount of money spent against Trump’s candidacy exceeds that of Clinton by a huge difference. Nevertheless, despite these factors, Trump had a successful race in Pennsylvania. The bar chart effectively helps us to visualize this insight."

The data in this dataset are segmented by age of the women. For this project, we have taken the data for All Ages, Ages Under 50 and Ages 50 & Over. To note, this data explicitly states that it does not include Nevada and Puerto Rico, but the dataset does not mention that Indiana is missing data, so we are taking all the states (including Hawaii and Alaska) besides Nevada and Indiana for our analysis. With this data, we aimed to find whether there was a general trend of breast cancer across the USA and New England.\nFor the first segment of our analysis, we explored the late stage cancer incidence rates across all the states in the USA. For all age averages, southeastern states of Mississippi, Louisiana and Georgia shows the highest incidence. Massachusetts and Arizona shows the least incidence. For under 50 age averages, the northern and eastern states show the highest incidence. Interestingly, South Dakota has one of the minimum incidence rates unlike the surrounding states. The South has a general trend of least incidence. For over 50, the trend is similar to the all ages average with Mississippi, Louisiana and Georgia having the highest incidence.\nFor the second segment of our analysis, we explored the late stage cancer incidence rates across the New England area in the USA. For all age averages, New Hampshire and Connecticut had the highest incidence rates in the New England area, while Massachusetts had the lowest incidence rate. For under 50 age averages, Connecticut and Rhode Island show the highest incidence, while Massachusetts remains with the lowest rate. For over 50,the trend remains similar to the previous trend with all ages and under 50, showing New Hampshire with the highest rate, while Connecticut is second highest, similar to the trend in all ages. As always, Massachusetts remains the lowest incidence rate.\nOverall, some states show a general trend of late stage breast cancer incidence across all age groups. However, we cannot find a direct relationship between the cancer incidence rates and the geographical or population size. Therefore, we hypothesize that some other influencing factors should exist. Further metadata is required for more granular analysis. It may also help if we had data from Nevada and Indiana.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nJeremy Lyman. 2020. “NCI State Late Stage Breast Cancer Incidence Rates.” National Cancer Institute. https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/NCI::nci-state-late-stage-breast-cancer-incidence-rates/about."
