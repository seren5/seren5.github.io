Make a website

1.  Render your index.qmd to make your website.
    1.  If the website doesn't pop up go docs/index.html to look at it.
    2.  Delete the file called first_map_files, what happens to your first map page?
2.  Add the overview of the course to the the index as a link.

Edit the about

Edit the about.qmd to have some information about you. At the moment it is all about me. Render often and figure out what is changing as you edit.
