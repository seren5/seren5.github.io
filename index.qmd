Welcome to Emily's Website Portfolio!

This is the landing page.

Here's an interactive map of where I've lived (for fun) and my SDS 192 projects below (had permission from Maisha to include her name).

## Places I've Lived
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warnings: false
library(leaflet)

# Mapping the cities with the coordinates
locations <- data.frame(
  name = c("Shenyang", "New York", "Lyon", "Lisbon", "Luxembourg"),
  lat = c(41.8057, 40.7128, 45.75, 38.7169, 49.6117),  # Latitude
  lon = c(123.4328, -74.0060, 4.85, -9.1395, 6.13)  # Longitude
)

# Leaflet map with markers
map <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # OpenStreetMap tiles
  addMarkers(data = locations, 
             ~lon, ~lat, 
             popup = ~name)  # City names in popups

# Displays map
